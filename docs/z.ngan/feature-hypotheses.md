## 1. Fragmentation and Need for Unified Apps
### Moment of Struggle
Users frequently complain about juggling multiple apps for booking, consultations, and prescriptions, leading to "insane complexity" and wasted time (high in Germany, similar in Austria/Switzerland).

### Big JTBD
When I need to manage my health comprehensively, help me do everything in one app to avoid switching between different tools.

### Sub-jobs
- Search and book appointments (in-person or online) without a separate app.
- Access telemedicine and prescriptions without re-logging in multiple places.
- Track health history (appointments, prescriptions, consultations) in one centralized place.

### Feature Hypotheses
- Integrated dashboard with quick tabs for switching between booking, telemedicine, and prescription to reduce app-switching steps (hypothesis: Increase retention by 20% for users like Sarah and Marc).
- "Unified Health Timeline" feature displaying all health activities chronologically, with quick search (hypothesis: Reduce time to find old info from 5 minutes to under 1 minute, improving satisfaction for Helga).
- Seamless handoff from partner apps (like dm) via SSO to avoid re-login (hypothesis: Increase conversion rate from partners by 30%).

## 2. E-Prescription and Redemption Complexity
### Moment of Struggle
The e-prescription process is complex, with NFC issues, ePA setup, and verification errors, leading to "bureaucratic hurdles" and low adoption (prominent in Germany and Austria).

### Big JTBD
When I have an e-prescription, help me redeem and receive medication simply to avoid confusion and delays.

### Sub-jobs
- Scan or upload prescriptions without technical errors.
- Choose redemption options (online or offline) with clear guidance.
- Track order status and get reminders for refills on recurring prescriptions.

### Feature Hypotheses
- Step-by-step guidance with video tutorials and AR overlay for NFC scanning and ePA setup (hypothesis: Reduce redemption error rate by 40% for older users like Helga).
- "Smart Redemption Assistant" that auto-suggests the best option based on location and history (hypothesis: Speed up redemption from 5 minutes to 2 minutes, improving UX for Thomas).
- Automatic reminders for refills with one-tap reorder (hypothesis: Reduce missed medication cases by 25%, increasing loyalty for chronic users).

## 3. Accessibility and Usability Barriers
### Moment of Struggle
Apps are not user-friendly for non-natives, seniors, or old devices, with issues in language, compatibility, and readability (common across regions, especially Switzerland).

### Big JTBD
When I use a health app, help me access it easily regardless of digital skills or language to avoid feeling excluded.

### Sub-jobs
- Switch languages and customize interfaces (large fonts, high contrast).
- Get simple guidance for complex steps without external help.
- Ensure compatibility with older devices and common OS.

### Feature Hypotheses
- Multi-language switcher (starting with German/English/Turkish) with auto-detect based on device (hypothesis: Increase adoption in immigrant communities by 15%, supporting Elena).
- "Accessibility Mode" with voice-guided navigation and simplified flows (hypothesis: Reduce drop-off rate by 30% for moderate proficiency users like Helga).
- Onboarding quiz to customize UX (e.g., larger fonts for seniors) (hypothesis: Improve app rating from 4.0 to 4.5 based on usability feedback).

## 4. Waiting Times and Inefficiency
### Moment of Struggle
Long waits for appointments and consultations, with verification bugs and delays, leading to "wasted days" (high in Germany/Netherlands, related to doctor shortages).

### Big JTBD
When I need urgent or routine health care, help me get service quickly to avoid wasting time.

### Sub-jobs
- Find immediate or earliest available slots.
- Minimize wait times in telemedicine queues.
- Handle errors and verifications quickly without repetition.

### Feature Hypotheses
- "Instant Availability Search" with real-time updates from Curaay/Teleclinic (hypothesis: Reduce average wait time by 50%, supporting Marc).
- Queue management with estimated wait times and notifications when ready (hypothesis: Increase telemedicine completion rate by 25%, reducing frustration for Sarah).
- Auto-retry for verification errors with fallback options (e.g., manual input) (hypothesis: Reduce abandonment at verification step by 35%).

## 5. Data Privacy and Trust Concerns
### Moment of Struggle
Skepticism about data security, with examples like Doctolib sharing with Facebook, leading to high "not interested" rate (36% in Germany) and adoption barriers.

### Big JTBD
When I share health data, help me feel secure and in control to build long-term trust.

### Sub-jobs
- Understand how data is used and who accesses it.
- Easily manage privacy settings and delete data.
- Get transparent notifications about any changes.

### Feature Hypotheses
- "Privacy Dashboard" showing stored data, accessors, and one-tap revoke (hypothesis: Increase trust score by 20%, reducing "not interested" rate).
- Transparent consent flows with simple explanations before each share (hypothesis: Improve GDPR compliance and satisfaction for Thomas).
- Personal audit log for data activities (hypothesis: Reduce privacy complaints by 30%, supporting all personas).

## 6. High Costs and Unclear Value
### Moment of Struggle
Hidden costs and lack of transparency, especially in telemedicine and pharmacy, with comparisons like DocMorris's €10 credit but still "hidden costs" (moderate in Germany, tied to insurance).

### Big JTBD
When I use health services, help me understand costs and value clearly to avoid surprises and optimize spending.

### Sub-jobs
- View upfront costs before confirming.
- Compare options with incentives (e.g., credits, discounts).
- Track total costs and savings through the app.

### Feature Hypotheses
- Cost estimator tool calculating fees based on insurance and options (hypothesis: Reduce surprise charges by 40%, supporting Elena).
- Incentive matching (e.g., auto-apply €10 credit like DocMorris) (hypothesis: Increase redemption rate by 25%, competing with rivals).
- "Value Tracker" showing monthly savings (hypothesis: Increase retention for value-driven users like Thomas).
