## 4. Regulatory Landscape

### Key Legislation & Milestones

| Date | Milestone | Impact |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 2019 | Digital Healthcare Act (DVG) | DiGA included in GKV benefits |
| Jan 2024 | **E-Prescription Mandatory** | eRezept required for all GKV prescriptions |
| Mar 2024 | CardLink Approved | NFC-based e-prescription redemption enabled |
| Jan 2025 | **ePA Automatic Rollout** | Electronic health records auto-created for all GKV |
| Oct 2025 | Provider Upload Mandate | Hospitals/doctors must upload data to ePA |
| 2026 | **80% ePA Target** | Government goal for utilization |

### E-Prescription (eRezept) Status

- **Coverage:** All GKV prescription medications
- **Redemption Methods:**

  - Insurance apps (TK, Barmer, AOK)

|---------|-------------|
| NFC Card Availability | Many patients don't have NFC-enabled insurance cards |
| Registration Friction | gematik app requires card + PIN identification |

## 8. Key Insights & Recommendations

### Market Timing: Favorable

1. **Infrastructure Ready:** E-prescription mandatory, CardLink approved, ePA rolling out
2. **Consumer Behavior Shifting:** 64% using or interested in health apps
3. **Competitive Window:** No dominant unified solution yet (booking + telemedicine + prescription)

| **Emphasize Trust** | German users skeptical—prioritize data privacy messaging |
| **Offline Option Critical** | Legal requirement + user preference for choice |
