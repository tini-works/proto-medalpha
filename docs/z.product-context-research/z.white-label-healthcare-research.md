## White-Label Products in Healthcare Industry

Based on current web research, here's a comprehensive overview of white-label products in healthcare:

### Definition
White-label products in healthcare are pre-built solutions (software, supplements, medical devices, or services) developed by one company that another company can rebrand and resell as their own. Healthcare providers can offer these products under their brand without building them from scratch.

### Examples of White-Label Healthcare Products

1. **Telehealth Platforms**
   - Video consultation software
   - Remote patient monitoring systems
   - Virtual care management platforms

2. **Electronic Health Records (EHR) Systems**
   - Cloud-based patient record management
   - Practice management software
   - Billing and scheduling systems

3. **Medical Supplements & Nutraceuticals**
   - Vitamin and mineral supplements
   - Protein powders and wellness products
   - Personalized nutrition supplements

4. **Biomarker Testing Services**
   - At-home diagnostic kits
   - Blood testing panels
   - Genetic screening services

5. **Pharmacy Management Systems**
   - Inventory management software
   - Prescription processing platforms
   - Customer loyalty programs

6. **Wellness & Fitness Apps**
   - Health tracking applications
   - Mental health platforms
   - Chronic disease management apps

### Benefits for Healthcare Providers

- **Cost-Effective**: Avoid expensive custom development (savings of 60-80% vs. building from scratch)
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Deploy solutions in weeks instead of months/years
- **Focus on Core Business**: Concentrate on patient care rather than technology development
- **Scalability**: Easy to expand offerings without technical overhead

- Regular audits and compliance monitoring required

**FDA Regulations**:
- Medical devices and diagnostic tools must meet FDA standards
- Software as Medical Device (SaMD) classifications apply
- Clinical validation and testing requirements

**Other Regulations**:
- State-specific healthcare licensing requirements
